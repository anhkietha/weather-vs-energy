# Introduction of intended use for code
#    - The code will be used to observe the pre-processing step, feature selection and the supervised machine learning.
#      In addition, it also contains the notes for each step performed and the plots which are discussed in the report.
# File structure and use of each file
#    - Our file structure are 4 jupyter notebook files which will perform
#      the pre-processing and analysis for each city in the weather dataset.
#    - After running the some blocks of code for graphing, it will also output the png file to show the plot easier.
# Instructions on how to run your code.
#    - For each jupyter notebook file, it should be gone through each blocks of code from the top down to observe
#      part by part from the observation of the dataset to the pre-processing and supervised machine learning. 
# Any additional requirements needed to run code.
